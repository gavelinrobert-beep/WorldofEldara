**A serious, lore-driven MMORPG set in the World of Eldara.**

> *"The Worldroot is bleeding. Memory awaits. What will you preserve?"*

## 🌍 What is World of Eldara?

World of Eldara is a **PC-based fantasy MMORPG** where ancient cosmic forces, divine fragments, and mortal ambition collide. Built on deep, immutable lore, every game system—from character classes to combat mechanics—is grounded in the world's narrative structure.

This is **not a browser game, not mobile, not casual**. This is a desktop PC MMORPG in the tradition of World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and Elder Scrolls Online.

### Core Pillars

- **Lore-First Design**: All systems respect canonical world truth
- **Server-Authoritative**: Secure, fair, competitive gameplay
- **Epic Scale**: Designed for thousands of concurrent players
- **Player Agency**: Choices have permanent consequences
- **Cosmic Stakes**: The world is failing—players decide what comes next

## 📖 The World

Eldara is not a natural world. It is a **containment engine** built by beings called the Architects to resist **the Null**—an entropic force that erases meaning itself.

At the core lies the **Worldroot**: a planetary nervous system, memory archive, and reality stabilizer. But the Worldroot is under strain. Memory is overflowing. Giants are stirring. Gods are fragmenting.

**Players are the unrecorded variable**—entities not fully bound by the Worldroot's deterministic patterns. Their actions create statistical noise that neither gods nor fate can predict.

👉 **Read the full lore**: [`WORLD_LORE.md`](WORLD_LORE.md)

## 🎮 Key Features

### Playable Races (Lore-Grounded)

- **Sylvaen** (Wood Elves): Born from Worldroot consciousness, feel ecological imbalance
- **High Elves**: Exiled reality-hackers who broke death itself
- **Humans**: The unrecorded anomaly—origin unknown, unpredictable
- **Therakai** (Beastkin): Descended from a shattered god's choice-fragments
- **Gronnak** (Orcs): God-eaters living atop a reality scar
- **Void-Touched**: Phase-shifted survivors of Void exposure

### Class System (12 Classes)

Each class represents a philosophical stance on Eldara's crisis:

- **Memory Warden** (Sylvaen Tank): Preserve what remains
- **Temporal Mage** (High Elf DPS): Transcend current limits
- **Unbound Warrior** (Human Hybrid): Adapt and survive
- **Totem Shaman** (Therakai Healer): Balance instinct with wisdom
- **Berserker** (Therakai DPS): Embrace pure fury
- **Witch-King Acolyte** (Gronnak DPS): Dominate through power
- **Void Stalker** (Void-Touched Stealth): Escape the system
- ...and more

### Magic Systems

All magic has a **source and consequence**:

- **Worldroot Magic**: Nature, growth, life (draws from ecosystem)
- **Divine Fragments**: Faith-based power (requires belief to stabilize gods)
- **Arcane Manipulation**: Reality editing (bypasses Worldroot restrictions)
- **Primal Instinct**: Totem spirits (surrender control for power)
- **Dominion Magic**: Consumed divinity (corrupts user with Null whispers)
- **Void Attunement**: Entropy itself (strips away meaning)

### World Structure

**Starter Zones** (1-10): Faction-specific, lore-integrated
- Thornveil Enclave (Sylvaen)
- Briarwatch Crossing (Sylvaen secondary hub linked to Thornveil)
- Temporal Steppes (High Elves)
- Borderkeep (Humans)
- The Untamed Reaches (Wildborn Therakai)
- The Scarred Highlands (Gronnak)

**Endgame Zones** (60+):
- **The Root Core**: See the Green Memory, including your absence from it
- **The Null Threshold**: Where Eldara meets oblivion

### Endgame Content

- **World Raids**: 40-player raids (The Root Core, God's Corpse, Temporal Labyrinth)
- **Factional Warfare**: Territory control, siegeable fortresses
- **Giant Awakening**: Server-wide events with permanent consequences
- **The Choice**: Collective player actions determine the world's fate

**✓** = Implemented  
**Future** = Planned

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 8 SDK** - [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- **Git** - For version control
- **(Optional) Unreal Engine 5.7** - For client development

### Running the Server

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gavelinrobert-beep/WorldofEldara.git
   cd WorldofEldara
   ```

2. **Build the server**
   ```bash
   cd Server/WorldofEldara.Server
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   ```

### Bringing up the Unreal client prototype

1. Install **Unreal Engine 5.7**.
2. From the repository root, open `Eldara.uproject` (Engine will generate project files and compile the `Eldara` module on first launch).
3. Editor targets (`EldaraEditor.Target.cs`) are present so you can build from the Unreal Editor or via `UnrealEditor` command line.
4. Core gameplay classes live in `Source/Eldara` (GameMode, GameInstance, PlayerController, AI, DataAssets).
5. Default configuration lives in `Config/DefaultEngine.ini` and `Config/DefaultGame.ini` (currently using the engine placeholder map `/Engine/Maps/Entry` with `EldaraGameModeBase`).

#### Quick Unreal sanity check (no engine required)

Run a lightweight validation of the Unreal project wiring:

```bash
python unreal_project_check.py
```

### Building the Henky3D Game Client

The World of Eldara now includes an alternative rendering/engine layer using **Henky3D** (OpenGL 4.6 Core). This provides a minimal but functional game bootstrap for development and testing.

#### Prerequisites

- **CMake 3.20+** - Build system
- **C++20 Compiler** - MSVC 2019+, GCC 13+, or Clang 15+
- **OpenGL 4.5+** - Modern GPU with OpenGL 4.5 or higher
- **Linux**: X11 development libraries (`libx11-dev`, `libxrandr-dev`, `libxinerama-dev`, `libxcursor-dev`, `libxi-dev`, `libgl1-mesa-dev`)
- **Windows**: Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ development tools

#### Building

1. **Initialize the Henky3D submodule** (first-time setup)
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Create build directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Configure with CMake**
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   ```

4. **Build the game**
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --config Release -j$(nproc)
   ```

#### Running the Game

From the repository root:

```bash
./build/bin/WorldofEldaraGame
```

**Note**: The executable must be run from the repository root directory so it can find shaders at `external/Henky3D/shaders/`.

You should see:
```
==========================================
  World of Eldara - Henky3D Edition
  The Worldroot is bleeding. Memory awaits.
==========================================
[INFO] Engine initialized successfully
[INFO] Resolution: 1280x720
[INFO] Scene initialized with placeholder cube (representing the Worldroot)
[INFO] Game loop started
```

#### Controls

- **Mouse**: Look around (when camera control is enabled)
- **WASD**: Move camera forward/back/left/right
- **Q/E**: Move camera down/up
- **ImGui Panel**: Toggle camera controls, adjust settings, enable/disable shadows and depth prepass

#### What You'll See

- A rotating cube representing the **Worldroot** (the core of Eldara)
- Real-time lighting with directional shadows
- Debug UI showing FPS, draw calls, and scene statistics
- Camera fly-through controls for scene exploration

#### Asset and Shader Paths

- **Shaders**: Located at `external/Henky3D/shaders/` (automatically loaded by the engine)
- **Assets**: Place additional assets in the `assets/` directory (planned for future use)
- **Working Directory**: Always run the executable from the repository root

#### Environment Variables (Optional)

If you need to override asset paths:
```bash
export HENKY_ASSET_DIR=/path/to/custom/assets
./build/bin/WorldofEldaraGame
```

*(Note: Environment variable support is planned but not yet implemented)*

3. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   You should see:
   ```
   ===========================================
     World of Eldara - Authoritative Server
     The Worldroot is bleeding. Memory awaits.
   ===========================================
   [INFO] Server Name: World of Eldara - Server 1
   [INFO] Port: 7777
   [INFO] Max Players: 5000
   [INFO] Tick Rate: 20 TPS
   [INFO] World simulation started
   [INFO] Network server listening on port 7777
   [INFO] Server started successfully. Press Ctrl+C to shutdown.
   ```

4. **Server is now running!** Ready to accept client connections on port 7777.

### Configuration

Edit `Server/WorldofEldara.Server/appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "Server": {
    "Name": "World of Eldara - Server 1",
    "Port": 7777,
    "MaxPlayers": 5000,
    "TickRate": 20
  },
  "World": {
    "WorldrootStrainLevel": 0.5,
    "EnablePvP": true,
    "EnableGiantEvents": false
  }
}
```

### Testing (No Client Yet)

Since the Unreal client is not yet implemented, you can:

1. **Use packet sniffer tools** to see network traffic
2. **Write a test client** using the shared protocol
3. **Read the logs** to verify server operation
4. **Remember**: characters are persisted in-memory only for the running server process (no database yet). Restarting the server clears created characters.
5. **Movement**: the server reconciles movement using class movement speed and will correct client prediction if it diverges.

## 🧭 Quest System (Data-Driven, Branching, Persistent)

- **Data Assets**: `UEldaraQuestData` holds title, description, objectives, rewards, prerequisites, repeatable flag, and main story flag.
- **States**:
```cpp
UENUM(BlueprintType)
enum class EQuestState : uint8 { Inactive, Available, Active, Completed, Failed };
```
- **Objectives**: `UEldaraQuestObjective` base (BlueprintType, abstract) with `ObjectiveText`, optional flag, and `IsComplete` override.
  - Supports kill, talk, collect, explore, survive, choice, escort, defend.
  - Multiple objectives can progress simultaneously.
- **Conditions**: Reusable assets gate availability/branches.
  - Examples: race, faction rep, prior choices, corruption thresholds, time of day, hidden triggers.
- **State Management**: Server keeps `TMap<UEldaraQuestData*, EQuestState>` per player; validates objective updates, applies rewards, persists choices, and replicates quest state.
- **Dialogue Integration**: Nodes offer quests, branch on quest state, and record choices that complete/fail paths or unlock hidden quests.
- **Rewards**: Modular XP, items, currency, faction reputation, abilities, titles, cosmetics, or world-state changes (immediate or delayed/conditional).
- **World Impact**: Quests flip world-state flags that drive NPC presence, zone presentation, vendors, travel routes, and future quest unlocks.
- **Debug/Tooling**: Hooks for force-complete, reset quest, simulate choice, and view world-state flags for QA and live ops.

## 🌑 World Events & Corruption (Persistent, Player-Driven)

- **Corruption Metric**: Each zone tracks `CorruptionLevel` (0–100) with states Pristine, Tainted, Corrupted, Overrun, Lost; visuals/audio always reflect state.
- **Drivers**: Time, player actions, failed events, bosses, and narrative triggers push corruption; adjacent zones influence one another.
- **Events**: Threshold-driven event types—Cleansing, Invasion, Ritual, Defense, Escort, Boss Manifestation—respond to corruption instead of random timers.
- **Outcomes**: Success lowers corruption, restores vendors/travel, and unlocks story arcs; failure escalates enemies, locks quests, and spawns empowered bosses with mutators.
- **Factions**: Verdant Accord, Void cultists, pirates, etc., react uniquely with their own objectives and rewards.
- **Persistence & Safety**: World state persists server-side and is replicated to entering players; starter zones have corruption caps and accelerated recovery to protect onboarding.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Lore Governs Mechanics**: If a system contradicts lore, change the system
2. **Server Authority**: Client is display only (no client-side hacks)
3. **Player Choices Matter**: Permanent consequences, not just dialogue
4. **No Pure Good/Evil**: All factions have valid philosophies
5. **The World is Failing**: This is not status quo—it's a crisis

## 🔒 Security & Anti-Cheat

- **Server authoritative** - Client cannot directly modify game state
- **Movement validation** - Speed, teleportation, bounds checking
- **Ability validation** - Range, resources, cooldowns, line-of-sight
- **Lore validation** - Invalid race-class combos rejected
- **Rate limiting** - Packet flood protection

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **5,000 concurrent players** per server
- **20 TPS** stable tick rate
- **<200ms** client latency handling
- **<100MB** per 1,000 players memory usage
