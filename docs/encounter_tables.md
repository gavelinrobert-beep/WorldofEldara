# World of Eldara - Encounter Tables & Combat Design

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive encounter tables for all regions in World of Eldara, detailing monster families, elite encounters, boss mechanics, and regional combat themes. All encounters align with the world's lore as defined in WORLD_LORE.md.

## Encounter Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Lore-Driven Enemies**: Every creature exists for a reason within Eldara's ecosystem
2. **Escalating Complexity**: Encounters grow more mechanically sophisticated with player level
3. **Thematic Consistency**: Regional enemies reflect the zone's philosophical conflict
4. **Telegraphed Mechanics**: Clear visual/audio cues before dangerous attacks
5. **Risk vs Reward**: Elite and boss encounters offer superior loot and experience

### Encounter Categories

- **Trash Mobs** (Level-appropriate, 1-5 enemies): Standard combat encounters
- **Elites** (Level +1-2, 1-2 enemies): Challenging encounters requiring strategy
- **Mini-Bosses** (Level +3-5, solo): Significant threats, memorable fights
- **World Bosses** (Level +5-10, group required): Open-world raid targets
- **Dungeon Bosses** (Level-appropriate, group required): Instanced major encounters
