## Starter Zone Build Checklist (Unreal assets)

This section maps the Whispering Canopy slice to concrete Unreal folders, assets, and behavior targets so the team can stand up the starter zone quickly. Use the default Unreal scale of **1 uu = 1 cm** for the conversions below.

### Core folders and key assets
- `Content/World/StarterZone/Maps/`: `StarterZone_P` (persistent) plus sublevels `StarterZone_Lighting` and `StarterZone_Gameplay`.
- `Content/World/StarterZone/Environment/`: landscape heightmap, foliage clusters, rock/prop static meshes.
- `Content/World/StarterZone/Nav/`: `SM_NavMeshBoundsVolume` placement and Recast settings tuned for a small tiled area.
- `Content/World/StarterZone/AI/`: Behavior Trees (`BT_Starter_Melee`, `BT_Starter_Ranged`), Blackboards (`BB_Starter_Enemy`), optional EQS, AIControllers (`BP_AI_ForestSprite`, `BP_AI_Thornling`).
- `Content/World/StarterZone/NPC/`: `BP_NPC_Greeter`, `BP_NPC_QuestGiver`, `BP_NPC_Vendor` (optional), dialogue data assets.
- `Content/World/StarterZone/Enemies/`: `BP_Enemy_ForestSprite` (melee) and `BP_Enemy_Thornling` (ranged) plus their BT/BB links.
- `Content/Data/Quests/`: DataAssets or DataTables for kill/collect quests.
- `Content/Data/Items/`: Starter gear/consumables and loot tables.
- `Content/Data/Spawns/`: `BP_SpawnVolume` variants per archetype with timers/respawn caps.
- `Content/UI/`: Tutorial tips, quest log hooks, and objective markers.

### Map layout beats
- **Spawn Hub (safe):** PlayerStart cluster with a safe-radius volume, Greeter + QuestGiver + optional Vendor, and tutorial widgets.
- **Path Out:** Short lane to a melee Combat Pocket (ForestSprites).
- **Side Pocket:** Gathering or ranged enemy (Thornlings) pocket.
- **Loop Back:** Return path to QuestGiver with a landmark (rock arch or stump tower) for orientation.
- **Bounds:** Blocking volumes or cliffs to prevent leaving the prototype space; soft fall volumes, no death pits.

### NPCs and quest chain (IDs kept consistent)
- **Greeter (`NPC_Starter_Greeter`):** One-line welcome, movement/camera tips, optional potion/weapon grant.
- **QuestGiver (`NPC_Starter_QuestGiver`):** Two micro-quests  
  - **Kill Quest (`Q_Starter_Kill01`)**: “Cull 3 Forest Sprites.”  
  - **Collect Quest (`Q_Starter_Collect01`)**: “Gather 5 Thorny Pods” (from Thornlings or pickup actors).  
  - **Rewards:** Starter weapon/armor, small currency, pointer to next zone.
- Optional **Vendor (`NPC_Starter_Vendor`)** with starter consumables.

### Enemies and AI behavior
- **ForestSprite (melee):** Detection radius of 800 Unreal units (uu) / 8 m; BT flow = Sense (AISense_Sight) → MoveTo target → Melee task; abort on lost sight.
- **Thornling (ranged):** Keeps distance; BT flow = Maintain radius MoveTo → Fire projectile task → optional strafe.
- Perception: Sight only, tuned to the compact playspace; hearing optional.
- Spawning: `BP_SpawnVolume` with concurrent cap, timer-based respawn delay per pocket.

### Data-driven setup
- DataTables or PrimaryDataAssets for enemy stats (HP, damage, move speed, exp), loot tables (item + weight), quests (id, steps, counts, rewards), and NPC dialogue (ids like `NPC_Starter_Greeter`).
- Keep identifiers aligned: `Zone_Starter`, `Q_Starter_Kill01`, `Q_Starter_Collect01`, `Enemy_ForestSprite`, `Enemy_Thornling`.

### Player safety & onboarding
- Apply brief spawn invulnerability volume/buff at hub.
- Tutorial prompts for movement, jump, inventory, map, quest log.
- Show prompts on first spawn only to reduce clutter for returning players.
- Soft walls and gentle fall volumes; no lethal pits in the slice.

### Navmesh & performance notes
- NavMesh bounds sized to 12,000 uu per side (120 m) covering the hub and combat pockets.
- Tile size 300 uu (3 m); cell size 30 uu (0.3 m) to keep tile counts low while keeping pocket pathing precise.
- Enable runtime nav generation only if iteration demands it; otherwise keep static.
- Simple collision on foliage/rocks; ensure LODs and culling on distant props/effects.

### Integration hooks
- Map should reference `EldaraGameModeBase` (`/Script/Eldara.EldaraGameModeBase`) and `EldaraGameInstance` (`/Script/Eldara.EldaraGameInstance`) as configured in `Config/DefaultEngine.ini`.
- PlayerStart logic: if persistence exists, respect saved location; otherwise spawn at hub.
- Quest/inventory UI should surface the starter quests and loot drops; AIControllers should auto-assign BT/BB assets.

## Unreal Engine Build Guide (Thornveil Enclave / Whispering Canopy)

Actionable Unreal steps to stand up the first starter zone using the existing project structure and lore.

### 0) Prep
- Open `Eldara.uproject` (UE 5.7) from repo root; let the editor generate project files.
- Create a dedicated map: `Content/WorldofEldara/Maps/Thornveil/WhisperingCanopy.umap`.
- Enable **World Partition** + **One File Per Actor** to keep iteration fast.
- Set GameMode to `EldaraGameModeBase` (already in `Config/DefaultGame.ini`) and use the shared `Eldara` module for code hooks.

### 1) Greybox Blockout (aligns to Main Areas)
- **Root's Embrace**: Flat safe spawn, short sightlines, gentle slopes.
- **Whispering Glade**: Open clearing hub with radial paths.
- **Ruptured Root**: Corruption pit; carve trench with height change for line-of-sight breaks.
- **Canopy Watch**: Platforms linked by ramps/ladders; add fall volumes for testing.
- **Verdant Shrine**: Circular boss arena with clean navmesh; leave room for rune mesh and boss VFX.
- Use simple cubes/planes; bake in traversal intent (cover, jumps, choke points) before art.

### 2) Lore-Grounded Set Dressing
- **Worldroot memory**: Place a giant root spine through the zone; add pulsing emissive material near the Ruptured Root.
- **Bioluminescent flora**: Blue/green emissive mushrooms and vines to sell the Thornveil biome.
- **Faction identity (Covenant)**: Covenant banners near hubs; stone-and-wood motifs, no metal spires.
- **Memory Echoes**: Place 2–3 interactable lore tablets (DataAsset or Blueprint) that play VO/text about the Worldroot crisis.

### 3) NPCs & Spawners
- Create NPC Blueprints for Elder Tharivol, Keeper Syliana, Scout Aeloria, Herbalist Talon; tag them with faction **Covenant**.
- Enemy spawners by band: small wildlife near Root's Embrace, elites inside Ruptured Root, flying actors near Canopy Watch.
- Place boss spawn volume for **Sorrow Stag** at Verdant Shrine; reserve space for add spawners.

### 4) Quests & Interactables (server-auth pattern)
- Author quest DataAssets matching the chain ("Awakening" → "The Verdant Shrine") and bind to quest giver Blueprints.
- Use simple interactables for breach seals (Quest 7) and Worldroot fragment (Quest 10); trigger server events instead of local state.
- Add gatherable **Silverpetal** herb nodes in Whispering Glade with shared respawn timers.

### 5) Traversal, Navmesh, Lighting
- Bake NavMesh per World Partition cell; verify elites still find patrol loops in Ruptured Root trench.
- Add jump pads/ramps for Canopy Watch verticality; place fall-damage volumes tuned for starter safety.
- Lighting pass: soft green key light, cooler shadows; ensure night readability via bioluminescent props.

### 6) Integration & Testing
- Hook map into `DefaultGame.ini` as the startup map for local playtests under `[/Script/EngineSettings.GameMapsSettings]`: `GameDefaultMap=/Game/WorldofEldara/Maps/Thornveil/WhisperingCanopy`.
- Smoke test with 2 clients: spawn → chat → movement → combat → quest accept/complete → boss kill.
- Record perf: aim for 60 FPS with 20 test bots in Whispering Glade; profile Nanite/Lumen costs.

### 7) Content Checkpoints
- **Exit criteria for greybox**: All main paths traversable, quests trigger, boss placeholder kills, zero blocker nav holes.
- **Exit criteria for art pass**: Biome reads as Thornveil Enclave, corruption VFX present, Covenant visual identity visible from spawn.
- **Exit criteria for polish**: Voice lines hooked for Elder Tharivol/keeper beats, Memory Echo tablets playable, side quests reachable without confusion.
